# 1.1.4 Changelog

## New

- Switched over to JourneyMap configuration. To access new config, press `J`, click the options icon next to the waypoint button second from the far left, then click "Addon Options"
- Added support for Forge and Neoforge

## Bug fixes

- Due to new MultiLoader setup, there are probably infact *more* bugs. Please report any with a GitHub issue or tell me in the discord server (just @ me)

## Persistent bugs (only with newer versions of journeymap)

- Dragging and dropping waypoints does not work yet again, not my fault will be fixed with new JourneyMap version (use JM beta.54 or newer if avalible)

## Future beyond v1.1.4

Ports for new minecraft versions and nothing more. This mod is finished in my eyes and I have no further ideas.
If there are any bugs that are found, let me know via issue or discord and I will fix them.
If you have some sort of feature request I will do my best to fulfill it but as for me, I have no further ideas.

Thank you for anyone who has showed an interest, joined the discord or just has used the mod.
